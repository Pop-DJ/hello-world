Heyo I am Dylan.  I think plants are neccessary in life and believe sustainable gardening can be applied to any occupation. Looking to get my name out there and learn more about programming to get some work.  Need to make some cash to starta legit ommunity garden in my poor desert home town, but not many jobs here looking to bring in income from online being so far away. However, I love open source I am a linux Ubuntu user favorite programing language is python, but my schooling consists of assembly and c++.  Schooling in visual basic as well if you even call that programing ahahahah. I am open to learning more about languages I know and learning new languages I do not. The next language I am aiming for is http. Latter on I would like to get to know c and java.
